# Get Customer Role

When you get the Customer role, you can see customer-specific channels and categories on our discord server and get support by opening a support request.

If you link your discord account for purchases on Tebex, you can automatically get the customer role, but if you don't get the customer role automatically, keep following the steps.

<Steps>
    ### Copy Transaction Tebex ID
    First, you need to copy the transaction ID from the Tebex website. You can find the transaction ID in the <a href={'https://checkout.tebex.io/payment-history/login'} style={{ color: '#008ae6' }}>purchase history</a> section.
    
    ### Go to Discord
    Go to the channel named <a href={'https://discord.com/channels/1262984500137299978/1276916711743815821'} style={{ color: '#008ae6' }}>`üêªÔ∏±tebex-claim`</a> and you can get your customer role with `/claim [tansaction-id]`.
